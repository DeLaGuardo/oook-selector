* [x] idea: maybe use a separate history when temporarily switched to modules database (20160921 mgr)
**    => Not done but not necessary anymore as of xdmp-buffer-path and xdmp-buffer-database.
* [x] C-c m t takes region instead of current line if region is marked, otherwise the string at point
* [x] Return key in file list opens document at point
* [ ] use an Emacs rest interface to implement xdmp-document-load/rest-from-file without lambdawerk.marklogic.
