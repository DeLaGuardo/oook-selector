# Setup an intial database and REST server
To configure a minimal MarkLogic REST server
including a content database and a modules database, together with forests,
run:
```
  cd ~/src/oook-selector/doc/example-db
  . create-rest-instance.sh 
```

Note: This script expects MarkLogic to be running on localhost with an admin:admin account,
that is, the username is "admin" and the password is "admin".

To remove this REST server together with its content database, modules database, and the forests,
run:
```
  cd ~/src/oook-selector/doc/example-db
  . delete-rest-instance.sh
```
